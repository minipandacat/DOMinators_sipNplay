            Founder, Jonathan Li, shares a passion for board games, boba, and
            delicious food, so he combined them all to become Sip & Play, Park
            Slopeâ€™s first board game cafe. <GiSpades className="spade" />It is a straightforward concept, come
            in with your friends and family to play any board game from our
            library of 300+ games! We hope when you visit, you also enjoy our
            coffee, espresso, boba, sandwiches, and snacks!
